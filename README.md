# AppConfigSwift

A useful library to support multiple build configurations or global settings in one application build.


### Integration guide

The library is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add one of the following lines to your Podfile.

```ruby
pod "AppConfigSwift", '~> 1.1.1'
```

The above version is for Swift 4.1. For older Swift versions use the following:
- Swift 4.0: AppConfigSwift 1.1.0
- Swift 3: AppConfigSwift 0.7.2
- Swift 2.2: AppConfigSwift 0.7.0


### Status

This library has moved [here](https://github.com/crescentflare/DynamicAppConfig). The new DynamicAppConfig repository continues development and includes Android support.
